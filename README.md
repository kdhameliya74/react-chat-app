# ðŸš€ Full Stack Project â€“ Frontend & Backend in One Repo

This is a full-stack JavaScript application where both the frontend and backend reside in the same project directory. This structure keeps the project organized and easy to manage.

## ðŸ“¦ Installing Dependencies

After cloning the repo or switching environments, you need to install dependencies separately for backend and frontend:

```bash
# Backend dependencies
cd backend
npm install

# Frontend dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

Happy Coding! ðŸ’™ðŸ’œ

You can save this as `README.md` in your root directory and you're good to go. Want me to generate a matching `.gitignore` file too?
